# NamesDatabase
A database of the popularity of UK and US names. Includes rank, percentile and more. Only names which have occurred at least 5 times are included, this is due to a limitation of the raw data provided.

Huge thanks to https://github.com/OpenGenderTracking/globalnamedata and data.gov for providing the raw data.

A non-processed Access variant (including popularity per name by year) is available as a [GitHub release](https://github.com/Leader-board/NamesDatabase/releases/tag/raw_data).
